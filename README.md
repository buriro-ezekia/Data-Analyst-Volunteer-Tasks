# Apple Search Ads Campaign Optimisation Project

## Overview
This project leverages Python and the Apple Search Ads API to analyse past campaign data, identify optimisation opportunities, and develop strategies for smarter Apple Search Ads campaigns. The project is divided into four phases, each with specific tasks and deliverables.

## Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Exploration

### App Store Connect & Apple Search Ads Access
- **Task**: Confirm access to App Store Connect (for the specific app) and the Apple Search Ads platform with appropriate permissions (campaign management and potentially data export).
- **Deliverable**: Confirmation of access to both platforms.

### Data Gathering
- **Task**: 
  - Collaborate with the marketing team to understand past campaign goals and targeting strategies.
  - Utilise App Store Connect to access historical in-app purchase data (considering privacy limitations).
  - Access the Apple Search Ads platform and download historical campaign data reports for the desired timeframe (impressions, clicks, conversions, cost).
- **Deliverable**: Compiled datasets containing past campaign data (Apple Search Ads) and potentially in-app purchase data (App Store Connect).

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **Task**: Clean and pre-process the downloaded datasets in Python (using libraries like Pandas). This involves handling missing values, formatting dates, and ensuring data consistency.
- **Deliverable**: Cleaned and preprocessed datasets ready for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Task**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the cleaned datasets using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib. This involves:
  - Analysing overall campaign performance metrics (impressions, clicks, conversions, cost).
  - Identifying top-performing and underperforming keywords based on clicks, conversions, and cost-per-acquisition (CPA).
  - Analysing trends in user acquisition and in-app purchase data (with privacy considerations).
- **Deliverable**: Insights and visualisations summarising key findings from the EDA (e.g., reports, dashboards).

## Phase 2: Campaign Optimisation and Strategy Development

### Keyword Optimisation
- **Task**: 
  - Identify high-performing keywords and negative keywords to exclude based on the EDA.
  - Research and suggest new keyword opportunities based on user search trends and app functionality.
- **Deliverable**: A list of recommended keyword optimisations (additions, removals, and potential new targets).

### Bidding Strategy Development
- **Task**: 
  - Analyse cost metrics (e.g., CPA) for different keywords and user segments.
  - Develop recommendations for optimising bidding strategies to maximise return on ad spend (ROAS). This involves:
    - Increasing bids for high-performing keywords.
    - Adjusting bids for underperforming keywords.
    - Implementing location-based bidding adjustments.
- **Deliverable**: A proposal for optimised bidding strategies based on data analysis.

### Campaign Structure Recommendations
- **Task**: Analyse the current campaign structure and suggest improvements based on the EDA. This involves:
  - Creating separate ad groups for different product categories or themes.
  - Refining audience targeting within ad groups.
- **Deliverable**: Recommendations for a more strategic campaign structure for future campaigns.

### A/B Testing Framework
- **Task**: Develop a framework for A/B testing different ad creatives and targeting options within Apple Search Ads. This involves creating variations of ad copy, testing different visuals, or experimenting with various audience segments.
- **Deliverable**: A documented A/B testing framework for future campaign optimisation.

## Phase 3: Implementation and Monitoring

### Campaign Implementation
- **Task**: Collaborate with the marketing team to implement the recommended keyword optimisations, bidding strategies, and potentially a new campaign structure within Apple Search Ads.
- **Deliverable**: Successfully implemented Apple Search Ads campaigns based on the analyst's recommendations.

### Performance Monitoring and Reporting
- **Task**: 
  - Develop automated Python scripts (using libraries like requests) to regularly retrieve data from the Apple Search Ads API and generate performance reports.
  - Track key performance indicators (KPIs) and monitor campaign performance over time.
  - Present regular reports to the marketing team highlighting campaign performance and suggesting further optimisations.
- **Deliverable**: Automated reporting system using Python and regular performance reports with actionable insights.

### A/B Testing and Refinement
- **Task**: 
  - Implement the A/B testing framework to compare different ad creatives, targeting options, and potentially landing pages within Apple Search Ads.
  - Analyse A/B test results and identify the most successful variations based on key metrics.
  - Continuously iterate and refine campaigns based on ongoing data analysis and A/B testing.
- **Deliverable**: Continuous improvement of Apple Search Ads campaigns through A/B testing and data-driven optimisation.

## Phase 4: Advanced Strategies and Automation

### Machine Learning Integration (Optional)
- **Task**: Explore the potential of integrating machine learning models for tasks like:
  - Automated keyword suggestion and bidding strategy optimisation.
  - User segmentation and targeted ad delivery.
- **Deliverable**: (Optional) A research report on the potential of machine learning integration for Apple Search Ads optimisation.

### Campaign Automation with Python
- **Task**: Develop Python scripts to automate repetitive tasks within Apple Search Ads campaign management. This involves:
  - Automating budget adjustments based on pre-defined rules.
  - Scheduling campaign reports for automatic generation and distribution.
- **Deliverable**: Automated scripts for repetitive tasks within Apple Search Ads management using Python.

### App Store Optimisation (ASO) Integration
- **Task**: 
  - Analyse how Apple Search Ads performance can be integrated with App Store Optimisation (ASO) strategies.
  - Explore how keyword research and targeting can be aligned across both ASO and Apple Search Ads for better visibility.
- **Deliverable**: Recommendations for a holistic approach integrating ASO and Apple Search Ads for improved app discoverability.

## Overall Deliverables
- Optimised and data-driven Apple Search Ads campaigns leading to improved user acquisition, conversions, and ROI.
- Automated reporting and insights for informed decision-making.
- A/B testing framework for continuous campaign improvement.
- Exploration of advanced strategies like machine learning integration and campaign automation (optional).
- Recommendations for a holistic approach integrating ASO and Apple Search Ads.
